# Airflow Playground

The primary goal of this repository is to store and track my progress in mastering Airflow concepts, including:

DAG Development: Creating and structuring various types of workflows.

Operators: Experimenting with core, community, and custom operators (e.g., BashOperator, PythonOperator, S3Hook, etc.).

Sensors: Implementing workflow dependencies using sensors.

Hooks & Connections: Learning to connect Airflow to external systems (databases, cloud services).

Scheduling & Backfilling: Understanding different scheduling intervals and manual trigger methods.
